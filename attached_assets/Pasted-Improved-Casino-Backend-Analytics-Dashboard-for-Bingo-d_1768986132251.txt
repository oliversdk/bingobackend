Improved Casino Backend & Analytics Dashboard for Bingo.dk

Overview

Bingo.dk is a Danish online casino (primarily offering bingo and related games) seeking to upgrade its backend system. The current backend is limited in analytics and data visibility, making it difficult to monitor key performance aspects. To run a successful online casino, it’s essential to track and analyze performance metrics – this provides insights into player behavior, financial health, and marketing effectiveness ￼. The goal is to design a comprehensive admin dashboard and backend that gives real-time, detailed data on users, games, and affiliates. This will empower data-driven decisions to improve profitability and user experience.

Key Requirements and Features

1. User Analytics and Player Performance
	•	Top Winners/Losers: Identify which users have won the most and which have lost the most over selectable time frames. This “leaderboard” of net winnings helps spotlight high-rollers and at-risk players.
	•	Individual User Lookup: Search and view a detailed profile for any user. For each player, show relevant data such as:
	•	Total amount won or lost (net profit for the user, which is net loss/profit for the house).
	•	Total bets placed and total payouts received.
	•	Deposits and Withdrawals: How much money the user has deposited vs. withdrawn over time (to understand their net cash flow).
	•	Gameplay Activity: Which games the user plays most frequently, their biggest win, biggest loss, and last active time.
	•	Account details: Registration date, current balance, and any flags (e.g. VIP status, responsible gambling limits, or suspicious activity).
	•	Net House Win per User: From the operator’s perspective, calculate how much revenue each user has generated. If a user has lost 500 DKK net, the house won 500 DKK from that user (and vice versa). This helps identify the most profitable players and those who have cost the casino money.

2. Game Performance and Financial Metrics
	•	Popular Games & Usage: Track which casino games (including bingo rooms, slots, etc.) are played the most. The dashboard should display the number of plays, unique players, and total wagers per game.
	•	Win/Loss per Game: For each game, show how much players have collectively won or lost. This translates to how much revenue each game generates for the casino. Monitoring Net Gaming Revenue (NGR) by game is crucial – it helps identify which games contribute the most to profits ￼. If certain games consistently lose money for the casino (i.e. players net win), those could be investigated or adjusted ￼. Conversely, games that are highly profitable can be promoted more.
	•	Real-Time Game Monitoring: Ability to see current game sessions or tables running, active player counts in each bingo room, and maybe live updates of big wins (jackpots) as they happen. This gives a live pulse of the casino activity.
	•	Financial KPIs: Display overall casino KPIs such as:
	•	Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR): Total bets minus payouts over a period ￼ ￼. This shows the basic revenue before costs.
	•	Net Gaming Revenue (NGR): Revenue after deducting bonuses, taxes, etc ￼. This reflects true profit from gaming operations.
	•	Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Average revenue per active player in a period ￼.
	•	Lifetime Value (LTV): Estimated total value of a player over their lifetime ￼ (useful for long-term planning).
	•	These metrics help assess financial health and game performance at a glance. As noted, monitoring metrics like GGR and NGR in real time helps the casino see its earnings and profitability clearly ￼.

3. Affiliate Tracking and Attribution
	•	Affiliate Source Identification: For each user account, record and display which affiliate (marketing partner) referred them (e.g. via an affiliate ID or code). This is critical for tracking the effectiveness of affiliate marketing and for revenue sharing calculations.
	•	Per-User Affiliate Data: On the user’s profile, include the affiliate referrer and the net revenue from that user. For example, if user X was referred by Affiliate Y and the user lost 1000 DKK overall, the casino earned 1000 DKK from that user (and may owe a commission to Y based on that).
	•	Affiliate Performance Dashboard: A section to aggregate data by affiliate: list each affiliate partner with metrics such as:
	•	Number of referred players (sign-ups) from that affiliate.
	•	Total GGR/NGR generated by those players (how much those players gambled and lost/won in total).
	•	House Profit/Loss by Affiliate: If players from a particular affiliate collectively have a net loss (profit for house) or net win (loss for house). This helps identify affiliates bringing high-value players versus those whose players tend to win and “cost” the casino money ￼. If some affiliates’ traffic leads to net losses for the casino, that might signal bonus abuse or unprofitable deals ￼.
	•	Affiliate revenue share or commission owed (if applicable), calculated from the above.
	•	Reports & Filters: The ability to filter the affiliate view by date range (to see monthly performance, etc.) and to export reports. This helps the marketing team optimize affiliate programs and cut loose unprofitable affiliates ￼.

4. Comprehensive Dashboard & Reports
	•	Executive Overview: A main dashboard screen that summarizes key stats in real time: active players right now, today’s GGR, today’s top winner/loser, number of new sign-ups today, etc. This gives a quick health check of the casino operations at a glance.
	•	Custom Reports: Flexible reporting tools to generate reports on various metrics (financial, user behavior, game stats) over custom date ranges. For example, a report of “Bets to Deposits ratio” can show if players are betting enough relative to their deposits ￼ ￼. A low ratio might indicate players deposit but don’t engage fully, signaling a need for better retention incentives.
	•	Segmentation & Filters: Filter data by game, by affiliate, by time period, or by user segments (e.g. VIP players, new players, etc.). For instance, view monthly active players vs. new registrations, or filter “last 7 days” top losses.
	•	Data Visualization: Use charts and tables for clarity. For example: a line chart of daily GGR, a bar chart of revenue by game, a pie chart of players by affiliate source, etc. Visualizing data helps spot trends and anomalies quickly.
	•	Alerts and Notifications: (Optional) Set up triggers for certain conditions – e.g. if a single user wins over a certain threshold in a session, or if an affiliate’s players collectively hit a large jackpot – the system could flag this. Real-time alerts can help the team respond promptly (for risk management or congratulatory marketing).

5. Real-Time Monitoring and Updates
	•	The new backend should support real-time data updates. Key figures on the dashboard (like active players, ongoing games, recent big wins, current day GGR) should update without requiring a page refresh. This likely involves using WebSockets or periodic AJAX polling to fetch live data.
	•	Live Casino Monitoring: A real-time feed or panel showing current activity: e.g. “X players online now, Y games in progress, latest win: User123 won 500 DKK on SlotZ at 14:32”. This creates a live overview of the platform’s activity.  ￼ ￼.
	•	Scalability: The system must handle the existing user base of 20,000+ users and scale beyond. Real-time monitoring and analytics should be efficient (perhaps using aggregated in-memory data or caching for quick updates). As PieGaming’s documentation suggests, modern iGaming back-office systems can handle large user bases in real-time with proper architecture ￼.

6. Integration with Existing Systems
	•	Database Integration: The solution will connect to the existing database (which contains ~20k user records and presumably game transactions). We will either build queries on this DB or set up a separate data warehouse for analytics if needed. The schema needs to provide access to game results, bets, wins, user info, and affiliate info.
	•	Technology Stack: (Since the current stack is not clearly identified from bingo.dk/admin, we assume flexibility for the new solution.) We can implement the backend in a modern web framework suitable for analytics dashboards. For example: a Node.js/Express or Python/Django backend for APIs, and a React or Angular frontend for the dashboard UI. The exact stack can be chosen based on existing infrastructure and team expertise. The focus is on a secure, performant system that can run queries on large data sets quickly.
	•	Security & Compliance: Because this is a gambling platform, all user data and financial records are sensitive. The backend must enforce strong access control (admin login, roles/permissions) and keep data secure (encryption in transit, secure storage). Audit logs should track admin access to data. Also, ensure compliance with any Danish Gambling Authority reporting requirements – e.g. the system might need to output certain reports for regulatory compliance.

7. Additional Relevant Metrics (Optional Enhancements)

Beyond the immediate asks, there are other data points that can enrich the casino’s insight:
	•	User Acquisition and Retention Metrics: Track conversion from sign-ups to first deposit (registration-to-deposit conversion rate) and monitor churn. For instance, how many new players stick around and become active regulars. This can inform marketing efforts.
	•	Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Calculate an estimate of each user’s lifetime value based on their net deposits and activity over time ￼. High CLV players might be VIP targets, whereas negative value players (who only win) might be bonus abusers or very lucky outliers.
	•	Session Analytics: Average session length, average bet size, and other behavioral metrics. These help understand player engagement. If players have short sessions or low bet amounts, the UX or game offerings might need improvement.
	•	Bonuses and Promotions Impact: If the casino offers bonuses (free spins, deposit match, etc.), the dashboard can show how bonuses are affecting play. For example, track how many bonus recipients convert to paying players, or how bonuses impact the NGR (since bonuses are a cost that reduces NGR ￼).
	•	Responsible Gambling Indicators: Data to identify problem gambling behavior, such as rapid losses or very long sessions, could be included. This ensures the casino can intervene for player safety if needed (and is often a license requirement).

Each of these additional metrics can be built into the dashboard or added over time. The key is that all critical data is unified in one admin interface, rather than scattered, to maximize operational insight.

Conclusion

In summary, the proposed backend dashboard will provide a comprehensive, real-time overview of the casino’s operations – from individual player stats to game performance and affiliate contributions. This kind of unified back-office system typically includes real-time monitoring, user management (CRM), financial analytics, and affiliate management modules ￼. By implementing these features, Bingo.dk’s team will gain valuable visibility into which users are most profitable, which games perform best, and which affiliates drive quality traffic. Armed with these insights (supported by data and metrics), the casino can make informed decisions to optimize its offerings, marketing, and player experience, ultimately leading to improved profitability and a competitive edge in the market ￼ ￼.
